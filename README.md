# cisc275-labs
All my labs for [CISC 275](http://www1.udel.edu/CIS/275/tharvey/20S/) for reference.

 - Lab 1: Simple Java class with methods.
 - Lab 2: Make an Orc bounce around a window in JavaFX.
 - Lab 3: Branch, staging, and commiting practice with git.
 - Lab 4: Lab 2's code reorganized into the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm.
 - Lab 5: More branch and git practice.
 - Lab 6: Lab 4's code, but the View and images are replaced with a Bass swimming in a pond. Implemented Key listener's to have the fish move in the user's specified WSAD-key direction.
 - Lab 7: Lab 6's code, but now there's a button to stop/start the Bass' movement.
